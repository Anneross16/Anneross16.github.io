Welcome! This is my personal portfolio. Here, you'll find my techical and creative writing. 

## About Me
I'm Anne Ross (it's a double name). I'm a recent graduate of NC State University, where I earned degrees in English (conc. technical and professional writing) and Spanish, as well as a minor in sociology. I've worked in several industries as a technical communicator, including software and hardware engineering, science and medicine, and law and politics. However, I'm currently preparing to serve as a Spanish literacy promoter in the Dominican Republic. 
In my free time, you may find me crocheting poorly, running the wrong way in Halo 4, or spending time outdoors.
