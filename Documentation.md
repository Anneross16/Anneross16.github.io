## Templates 
This is placeholder text. For my ENG 350 proposal, I committed to building out my site before adding in my personal work. My goal this summer is to continue fleshing out this space, including more CSS customization, integrating YAML, Jekyll, and JSON, and improving user interface. 

## Languages and Skills 
<ul>
	<li> Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
	<li> Back-End: C++, C#, Python, Ruby
	<li> Previous Projects: APIs and RESTful services, SEO, and UX and UI
</ul>

## FAQs
<ul>
	<li> What is a technical writer?</li> 
	Technical writers communicate complex information to a variety of audiences. We're best known for creating those instruction manuals that you get in a box and immediately throw away. In oher words, we're often a behind-the-scenes folk. Those start-up commands you get when you have a new phone? Techcomm! Instructions for taking a new medication? Techcomm! Posters that tell you to how to get vaccinated, where to vote, when to buy local, what to order at a coffee shop... that's all techcomm. We're responsible for the things that tell you to take action (like this site!)
	<li> What is a template? </li>
	Templates are predesigned layouts for specific types of technical communication. Since a lot of our writing is iterative and maintenance-based, templates improve efficiency and continuity. 
	<li> What kind of technical writing do YOU do? </li>
	I have over a year of experience in software, particularly with APIs. However, I've also worked with scientific and medical communication (HIV/AIDS and vaccine hestitancy campaigns), as well as legal writing (state political work). 
	<li> Do you do contract work? </li>
	Yes! Please reach out to discuss.
