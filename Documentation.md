## Templates 
This is placeholder text. For my ENG 350 proposal, I committed to building out my site before adding in my personal work. My goal this summer is to continue fleshing out this space, including more CSS customization, integrating YAML, Jekyll, and JSON, and improving user interface. 

## Languages and Skills 
<ul>
	<li> Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
	<li> Back-End: C++, C#, Python, Ruby
	<li> Previous Projects: APIs and RESTful services, SEO, and UX and UI
</ul>

## FAQs
<ul>
	<li> What is a technical writer?</li> 
	Technical writers communicate complex information to a variety of audiences. We're best known for creaeting those instruction manuals that you get in a box and immediately throw away. In oher words, we're often a behind-the-scenes folk. Those start-up commands you get when you have a new phone? Techcomm! Instructions for taking a new medication? Techcomm! Posters that tell you to how to get vaccinated, where to vote, when to buy local, what to order at a coffee shop... that's all techcomm. We're responsible for the things that tell you to take action (like this site!)
